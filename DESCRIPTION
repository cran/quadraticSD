Description: Given a dataset, the user is invited to utilize the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) 
              to guess interactively the mean and the mean deviation. Thereafter,
              using the quadratic curve the user can guess the Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) 
              and visualize the standard deviation (SD).
